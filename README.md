## ineffectua.com

I thought I might use [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) and [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) to maybe make ineffectua.com and develop my knowledge of different tech a bit.

Includes [Material-UI](https://mui.com/) which relies on [Emotion](https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction) and AWS support via [aws-sdk](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-js), which is probably overkill just to use S3 for images.

### Status

- `2021-10-11`: Added image support via AWS S3
- `2021-10-08`: This is merely a sandbox I've only just started
